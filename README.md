# MorseProject
A project made for university subject Microcomputers.

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and an interesting way of communicating, using simple technology, and getting more people interested
to learn Morse code. Two ATmega32U4 microcontrollers from the Atmel family were used for the project, each integrated on one plate, made by the
Bjelovar University of Applied Sciences teacher. The tile contains many components that use red and green LEDs and associated resistors, LCD screen
and ports for serial communication. In addition to these two tiles, another tile was also used for communication between the microcontrollers and
there are two lasers and two photoresistors on it. Microcontrollers are used to realize physical interaction, while they use Morse code
as a sign language for conveying information. A C# application serves as an interface for entering code or words that are then, if necessary,
translated into Morse code in the application itself and sent encoded to the other microcontroller.
